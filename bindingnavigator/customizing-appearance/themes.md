# Themes

You can customize the visual appearance by using [Visual Style Builder]({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder%}). You can either edit the predefined themes or create a custom ones. Please note that the element styles are reused and for __RadBindingNavigator__ you can customize the only the fill, the border and the buttons' images. If you want to customize other button elements you must change the styles of `RadButtonElement`.

## Changing the Fill and Border in Visual Style Builder.

1. Open [VisualStyleBuilder]({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder%}).
2. Export the built-in themes in a specific folder by selecting `File >> Export Built-in Themes`.
3. Load a desired theme from the just exported files by selecting `File >> Open Package`.
4. Select __RadBindingNavigator__ in `Controls Structure` on the left side. Then, select __RadCommandBarElement__ in the `Elements` window.
