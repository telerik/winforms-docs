# Getting Started



There are three ways in which you can use the RadRibbonForm control:

1. Change the base class of a standard Windows Form to __Telerik.WinControls.UI.RadRibbonForm__

1. Drop a __RadRibbonBar__ control on a __RadForm__ control
          

1. Add a new __RadRibbonForm__ item to your project by right-clicking on the Project’s node in the Solution Explorer and selecting the "Add" option from the context menu.
          

##  Drag-and-Drop a RadRibbonBar Control on a RadForm

When you add a __RadRibbonBar__ control on a RadForm the Visual Studio Designer pops up a dialog which asks you whether you would like to switch the form’s behavior to __RadRibbonFormBehavior:__

After you choose to replace the form's default behavior with a __RadRibbonFormBehavior__, the RadForm is transformed to a __RadRibbonForm__:

Switching to __RadRibbonFormBehavior__ does not change the base class to __RadRibbonForm__ but enables the __RadRibbonForm__ functionality on the __RadForm__ control.
