# AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Amazon Web Services is a cloud platform that provides a wide range of cloud services. You can create a [free account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_channel=em&sc_campaign=wlcm&sc_publisher=aws&sc_medium=em_wlcm_3d&sc_detail=wlcm_3d&sc_content=other&sc_country=global&sc_geo=global&sc_category=mult&ref_=pe_1679150_261537980) that is available for a year and will allow you to explore the provided services. So do not hesitate to create a new account and explore the AWS and the examples from this section.

## Requirements

In order to build and run the examples from the articles you will need an active AWS account. Your system should have .NET Framework 3.5 or later and Visual Studio 2010 or later. In addition, we use the [AWS SDK for .NET](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/), which provides everything you need in order to build your application using Visual Studio. 

You can check the [Getting Started]({%slug cloud-services\aws\getting-started%}) article in order to setup your environment and start using the services.
