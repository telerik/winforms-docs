# SpellChecker



RadSpellChecker enables developers to add multilingual spell checking capabilities to
        their WinForms applications. The component is completely customizable and can be attached
        to any text-editing RadControl. You can also use it together with the standard
        Microsoft text-editing controls. It currently supports dozens of languages and can
        have custom user dictionaries for every language.

The end-user can check a given text for errors using one of the following modes:

* Checking words one by one

* Checking all words at once in a separate window

RadSpellChecker can be tweaked to:

* Spellcheck RadGridView editors.
          

* Support multiple languages – you can add dictionaries in any language and use them with RadSpellChecker.
