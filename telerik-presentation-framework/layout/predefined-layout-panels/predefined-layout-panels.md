# Predefined Layout Panels

Telerik UI for WinForms comes with a set of stock layout panels that handle most common layout tasks and also provide a basis for your own[custom layout panels]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/layout/custom-layouts%}). The layout panel objects all descend from [LayoutPanel]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/class-hierarchy/layoutpanel%}) and are found in the Telerik.WinControls.Layouts namespace. Panels are responsible for determining both the size and position of the primitives that they contain. Panels can be nested to create arbitrarily complex layouts. The Telerik Presentation Framework includes the following panels:


* __[StackLayoutPanel]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/layout/predefined-layout-panels/stacklayoutpanel%})__

* __[WrapLayoutPanel]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/layout/predefined-layout-panels/wraplayoutpanel%})__

* __[GridLayout]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/layout/predefined-layout-panels/gridlayout%})__

* __[ImageAndTextLayoutPanel]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/layout/predefined-layout-panels/imageandtextlayoutpanel%})__

* __[BoxLayout]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/layout/predefined-layout-panels/boxlayout%})__

* __[DockLayout]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/layout/predefined-layout-panels/docklayout%})__
