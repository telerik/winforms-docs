# Scheduler Navigation



## 

Built with usability in mind, Telerik Scheduler grants the user with familiar Microsoft Office-like UI and behavior,
        which means that no learning is required to work with the control.

A __Scheduler Navigator__ control at the top allows for quick switching between the available
        scheduler views ([Day]({%slug scheduler-views-day-view%}),
        [Week]({%slug scheduler-views-week-view%}),
        [Month]({%slug scheduler-views-month-view%}),
        [Timeline]({%slug scheduler-views-timeline-view%})),
          and to toggle weekends on/off. It also navigates back and forth within a view and shows the current dates in a fully
          customizable and localizable Date Header. The time zones drop down list of RadSchedulerNavigator allows the user to see the
          appointments according to a time zone different than the local time zone.
          [RadSchedulerNavigator]({%slug scheduler-scheduler-navigator-overview%}) can easily
        be bound to a RadScheduler instance both in the Visual Studio Designer and in runtime:

__Navigation to appointments outside of the active view__ - If there are no appointments for a particular period, RadScheduler shows smart navigation buttons which to take the user to the previous/next appointment:

__Keyboard support__ - In addition to using the mouse, date browsing can also be done using the keyboard, so your end-users can work with that data more easily;
