__Submit a New Issue at GitHub__

If you find an issue with our docs that need to be addressed, the best way to let us know is by creating an issue in our [Github repository] (https://github.com/telerik/winforms-docs/issues).

If you can provide a link to the closes anchor to the issue, that is even better.

So, if you find an issue in the docs, or even feel like creating new content, we’d be happy to have your contributions! The basic steps are that you fork our documentation and submit a pull request. That way you may contribute to exactly where you found the error.  After that, our technical writing team just needs to approve your change request. Please use only standard markdown.
