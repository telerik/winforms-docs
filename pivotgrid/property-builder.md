# Property Builder



## 

To setup your RadPivotGrid easily at design time you can invoke the RadPivotGrid Property Builder from the
          *SmartTag* menu of RadPivotGrid.

The RadPivotGrid Property Builder is a design time wizard that consists of a preview pane on the right side and also
          three tabs on the left which contain different editors that allow you to modify the most commonly used properties:
        

* __General tab__: on this tab you can set the __DataSource__ and
              __DataMember__ properties, as well as the __ErrorString__ and
              __EmptyValueString__ properties. Additionally there are a bunch of boolean properties
              related to enabling or disabling the build-in features of RadPivotGrid: drag & drop, context menus,
              sorting, filtering, resizing, etc.
            

* __Layout tab__: on this tab you can edit the properties related to modifying the appearance
              of RadPivotGrid, like the layout type of the headers, the positions of the __SubTotals/GrandTotals__
              and the width or height of the different areas.
            

* __Fields__: on this tab there is a RadPivotFieldList control which allows you to organize the
              fields from your data source in the desired descriptor collection.
