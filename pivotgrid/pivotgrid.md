RadPivotGrid for WinForms is a control which provides functionality similar to the functionality of PivotTables in MS Excel. It takes large chunks of data and summarizes it in a human readable way by the help of aggregates and field descriptors. The end-user can easily get an aggregated view of the data that would best suit their needs by dragging and dropping the items of the field descriptors and the aggregates. RadPivotGrid can also sort the data and show subtotals and grandtotals at the end or at the beginning of the summarized data. It supports the UI virtualization available in RadGridView, so it can easily handle large datasets bringing to you top performance and low memory footprint even in such scenarios. As a control based on the Telerik Presentation Framework, RadPivotGrid also supports themes that you can quickly personalize with the help of Visual Style Builder.
