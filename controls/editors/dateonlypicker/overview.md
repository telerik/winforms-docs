# WinForms DateOnlyPicker Net Core Overview


__RadDateOnlyPicker__ control for WinForms in .NET Core (or .NET 6/7/8 etc.) would serve as a specialized date picker that exclusively deals with __DateOnly__ objects instead of DateTime. In .NET, __DateOnly__ is a new struct introduced to represent dates without time, which is especially useful in applications like scheduling, reporting, or any scenario where only the date is relevant.
