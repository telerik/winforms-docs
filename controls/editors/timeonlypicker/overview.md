# WinForms TimeOnlyPicker Overview

The __RadTimeOnlyPicker__ control, designed specifically for handling __TimeOnly__ values in .NET Core, enables users to enter or select time values easily. It features an editable area for direct time entry and a dropdown with a __RadClock__ for hour and minute selection, supporting null values, 12- and 24-hour formats based on culture settings, and customizable formatting. This makes it ideal for applications that require precise time management without date components.
