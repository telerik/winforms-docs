# Themes

This help article will demonstrate a step by step tutorial how to customize the `ControlDefault` theme for __RadTimeOnlyPicker__. The __RadTimeOnlyPicker__ theme settings are the same as the RadTimePicker control. This means that the changes applied to the __RadTimePicker control__ in Visual Style Builder will also applied to the RadTimeOnlyPicker control.

1. Open [Visual Style Builder] ({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder/starting-vsb%})
2. Export the built-in themes in a specific folder by selecting `File` >> `Export Built-in Themes`.
3. Load a desired theme from the just exported files by selecting `File` >> `Open Package`.
4. Expand __RadTimePicker__ and select the `TimePickerBorder`.
