# Themes

This help article will demonstrate a step by step tutorial how to customize the `ControlDefault` theme for __RadTimeOnlyPicker__. The __RadTimeOnlyPicker__ theme settings are the same as the RadTimePicker control. This means that the changes applied to the RadTimePicker control in Visual Style Builder will also applied to the RadTimeOnlyPicker control.

1. Open [Visual Style Builder] ({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder/starting-vsb%})
2. Export the built-in themes in a specific folder by selecting `File` >> `Export Built-in Themes`.
3. Load a desired theme from the just exported files by selecting `File` >> `Open Package`.
4. Expand __RadTimePicker__ and select the `TimePickerBorder`.
