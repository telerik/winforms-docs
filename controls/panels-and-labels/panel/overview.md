# Panel

The __RadPanel__ control comes with all the features of a standard panel and the additional ability to [customize the appearance]({%slug winforms/panels-and-labels/panel/creating-a-radpanel-with-gradient-background%}). You can refer to the [HTML-like Text Formatting]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/html-like-text-formatting%}) article to understand how to set a border, border width, background with a linear gradient, and Html-like formatted text. You can also use [Smart Tags]({%slug winforms/panels-and-labels/panel/design-time%}) and set [Properties]({%slug winforms/panels-and-labels/panel/properties%}).
