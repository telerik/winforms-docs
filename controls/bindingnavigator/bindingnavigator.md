# BindingNavigator

__RadBindingNavigator__’s main purpose is to provide a basic UI for navigation through a collection of business objects. It can be paired with a [BindingSource component](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingsource%28v=vs.110%29.aspx). The UI of __RadBindingNavigator__ allows you to add and delete objects. The Add operation depends on the setup of the underlying data source. You can also use [Smart Tags]({%slug winforms/bindingnavigator/smarttag%}), set [Properties]({%slug winforms/bindingnavigator/properties%}) and [Customize its Appearance]({%slug winforms/bindingnavigator/customizing-radbindingnavigator-%}).
