The printing support of __RadScheduler__, allows the end user to directly pass the RadScheduler data to the printer. Common features of the printing support in Telerik UI for WinForms suite are:

* __Page headers and footers__

* __Watermark__

* __Paper size settings__

* __Print preview dialogs__

__RadScheduler__ supports four print styles, similar to the Outlook ones: DailyStyle, WeeklyStyle, MonthlyStyle and DetailsStyle. In all modes, you can add to your pages an area for handwritten notes or a date header with calendar that shows the busy days.      

You can also print a single view on two pages which will grant you more available space and allow you to organize the printouts in a folder or notebook.      

## Printing

The RadScheduler has two public methods available for printing â€“ __Print()__ and __PrintPreview()__ methods. The first method will directly send a print job to the default printer with the settings currently saved in the __PrintStyle__  property. This method has one overload available which can show a system __PrintDialog__ with the available printers and their options.

The other available method is __PrintPreview()__. It opens a new RadPrintPreviewDialog which is discussed in details [here.]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/printing-support/end-user-functionality/print-preview-dialog%})
