# Events

The following events occur during the editing process:

* __CellValuesPushed:__ This event will be fired when the user has edited a value in the grid. This event should be used for updating the data source. If it is not handled the cell value would not be updated. Detailed information about how you can use this event is available [here]({%slug winforms/virtualgrid/working-with-data/handle-add-delete-update-of-rows%}).

* __EditorRequired:__ This is the first event that fires when a cell becomes editable (edit mode).
