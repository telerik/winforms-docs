# Busy Indicators

There are two ways to indicate that the grid need time to perform a specific operation. The first one is to show a waiting bar in front of __RadVirtualGrid__. This way the entire control will be unaccessible while the time consuming operation is executed. The second one is to show a waiting icon in the row header. This way you can indicate that a the data for a specific row is still not loaded.

## WatingBar

While this indicator is shown the entire grid is disabled. It is useful when the initial data loading requires more time.

The following snippet shows how you can show/hide the waiting bar:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\VirtualGrid\VirtualGridWaitingIndicators.cs region=WaitingBar}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\VirtualGrid\VirtualGridWaitingIndicators.vb region=WaitingBar}}
````C#
radVirtualGrid1.MasterViewInfo.IsWaiting = true;
radVirtualGrid1.MasterViewInfo.IsWaiting = false;

````
````VB.NET
radVirtualGrid1.MasterViewInfo.IsWaiting = True
radVirtualGrid1.MasterViewInfo.IsWaiting = False

````

## Waiting icon

The waiting icon can be shown in each row header. With it you can indicate that the row data is still not loaded.
