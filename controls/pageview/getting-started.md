# Getting Started with WinForms PageView

This tutorial will help you to quickly get started using the control.

## Adding Telerik Assemblies Using NuGet

To use `RadPageView` when working with NuGet packages, install the `Telerik.UI.for.WinForms.AllControls` package. The [package target framework version may vary]({%slug winforms-available-nugets%}).

Read more about NuGet installation in the [Install using NuGet Packages]({%slug winforms/nuget%}) article.

>tip With the 2025 Q1 release, the Telerik UI for WinForms has a new licensing mechanism. You can learn more about it [here]({%slug license-key%}).

## Adding Assembly References Manually

When dragging and dropping a control from the Visual Studio (VS) Toolbox onto the Form Designer, VS automatically adds the necessary assemblies. However, if you're adding the control programmatically, you'll need to manually reference the following assemblies:

* __Telerik.Licensing.Runtime__
* __Telerik.WinControls__
* __Telerik.WinControls.UI__
* __TelerikCommon__

The Telerik UI for WinForms assemblies can be install by using one of the available [installation approaches]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/installing-on-your-computer%}). 

## Defining the RadPageView

To use **RadPageView**, you can simply drag it from Toolbox and drop it onto your form in the Visual Studio designer and use its [Smart Tag]({%slug winforms/pageview/design-time%}) to add pages. To switch between the different view modes, you can set the **ViewMode** property in the *Properties* window of the control.

To adjust properties of the specific view, you should find the __ViewElement__ property in the property grid and expand its sub-properties where you can find settings specific to the currently active view. This is the general approach to set up the **RadPageView** control in the designer without considering the view mode.
