# PivotFieldListDragDropService

By using **RadPivotFieldList**, the end user can change the way of representing aggregated data in **RadPivotGrid** by modifying the column/row group descriptions, the aggregate descriptions or the report filters. The end users can do this by dragging fields across the four list boxes in **RadPivotFieldList** or by reordering the items in a single list. This functionality is achieved by the **PivotFieldListDragDropService**.
