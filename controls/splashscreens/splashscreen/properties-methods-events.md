>caution Note that the SplashScreen is created and shown in a separate System.Threading.Threads and it is required to use BeginInvoke/Invoke when accessing it from the main UI thread in order to prevent cross-thread exceptions. That is why the static RadSplashScreenManager offers similar methods to update the content in the splash screen in a safe way. Feel free to use the RadSplashScreenManager's when it is required to update the content of the splash in the main UI thread.

>caution Note that the events are created on a separate __System.Threading.Threads__ and it is required to use BeginInvoke/Invoke when accessing it in order to prevent cross-thread exceptions. Also, these events are static and you need to explicitly unsubscribe from them in order to prevent memory leaks. Each object that is subscribed to one of these events cannot be garbage collected.
