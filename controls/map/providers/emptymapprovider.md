# EmptyMapProvider

The __EmptyMapProvider__ is a provider which doesn't connect to any real imagery services. It provides definitions and methods which can be used to calculate positions of the framework elements, map shapes and pin points. By using this provider you can create map-relative applications which do not require visibility of the real map data (landscapes or roads), but which require visible elements to be positioned according to the geographical coordinates.
