# Azure Map Custom Provider

As of June 30, 2025, [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) will be deprecated. To support this transition, weâ€™ve provided an [SDK example in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/telerik/winforms-sdk/tree/master/Map/Custom%20Azure%20Provider) that demonstrates how to create a custom provider leveraging the Azure Maps API. Developers intending to use this approach will need to obtain a valid Azure Maps subscription key.
