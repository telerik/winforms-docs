# Providers Overview

The __RadMap__ control needs a provider of imagery data in order to display a map. Currently, __RadMap__ supports the following providers:

* [AzureMap Custom Provider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/azure%})
* [BingRestMapProvider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/bingrestmapprovider%})
* [OpenStreetMapProvider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/openstreetmapprovider%})
* [LocalMapProvider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/localmapprovider%})
* [EmptyMapProvider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/emptymapprovider%})

>note If your application targets .Net Framework version below 4.7, some providers will require explicitly to choose __TLS 1.2 SecurityProtocol__. This protocol can be set through the System.Net.ServicePointManager.**SecurityProtocol** property. More information is available here: [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with the .NET Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls).
