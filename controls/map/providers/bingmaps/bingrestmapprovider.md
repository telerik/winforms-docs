# BingRestMapProvider

>important Please note that [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) __will be deprecated effective June 30, 2025__. As an alternative, users can refer to the [SDK example available in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/telerik/winforms-sdk/tree/master/Map/Custom%20Azure%20Provider), which demonstrates how to create a __custom provider__ using the __Azure Maps API__. A __valid Azure Maps subscription key__ is required to use this functionality.

__RadMap__ can visualize tile data from the [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) REST service. You can enable tile caching to a local folder by setting a new __LocalFileCacheProvider__ to the BingRestMapProvider.__CacheProvider__ property.

>note You must provide a Bing Maps Key to the provider for it to work. To get your free Bing Maps Key, please refer to the following link: [Getting a Bing Maps Key](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx).

>note Only billable transactions count towards the free-use limits for Basic keys, and Enterprise keys are only charged for billable transactions. Non-billable transactions do not incur charges and do not count towards free-use limits. You can find additional information in the following link:  [Billable versus non-billable transactions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff859477.aspx).

>caution **BingRestMapProvider** internally loads tile data from the [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) REST service which requires **TLS 1.2** coming automatically with .NET Framework 4.7. For older .NET Frameworks, or because of some other Windows settings, it may be necessary to explicitly choose TLS 1.2 for your application by setting the System.Net.ServicePointManager.**SecurityProtocol** property to SecurityProtocolType.**Tls12**. More information is available here: [Transport Layer Security (TLS) best practices with the .NET Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls).

>note If you use __RadMap__ with .Net Framework 2.0 and you don't have an installation of the Telerik UI for WinForms suite on the current machine, it is necessary to add a reference to the Newtonsoft.Json assembly which can be found in the \Bin folder of the *Telerik_UI_For_WinForms_[version]_Dev_dlls.zip*. If you are using .Net Framework 4.0 this is not required.
