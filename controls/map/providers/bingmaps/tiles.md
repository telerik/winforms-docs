# Tiles

>important Please note that [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) __will be deprecated effective June 30, 2025__. As an alternative, users can refer to the [SDK example available in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/telerik/winforms-sdk/tree/master/Map/Custom%20Azure%20Provider), which demonstrates how to create a __custom provider__ using the __Azure Maps API__. A __valid Azure Maps subscription key__ is required to use this functionality.

[Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) provide a world map that users can easily pan and zoom. In order to achieve smooth users interaction, the map is pre-rendered at many detailed levels where each level is cut into tiles of 256 x 256 pixels each. Each tile is given XY coordinates ranging from (0, 0) in the upper left to (2<sup>level</sup>–1, 2<sup>level</sup>–1) in the lower right. For example, at level 3 the tile coordinates range from (0, 0) to (7, 7) as follows:

In order to optimize the tiles indexing, the two-dimensional tile XY coordinates are combined into one-dimensional strings called quadtree keys, or “quadkeys” for short. Each quadkey uniquely identifies a tile and it can be used as a key in common database B-tree indexes. To convert tile coordinates into a quadkey, the bits of the Y and X coordinates are interleaved, and the result is interpreted as a base-4 number (with leading zeros maintained) and converted into a string. For instance, given tile XY coordinates of (3, 5) at level 3, the quadkey is determined as follows:

tileX = 3 = 011<sub>2</sub>

tileY = 5 = 101<sub>2</sub>

quadkey = 100111<sub>2</sub> = 213<sub>4</sub> = “213”

Finally, tiles that are close to each other have quadkeys that are relatively close together. This is important for optimizing performance, because neighboring tiles are usually requested in groups.
