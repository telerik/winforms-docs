# Imagery sets

>important Please note that [Bing Maps](https://www.bingmapsportal.com/) __will be deprecated effective June 30, 2025__. As an alternative, users can refer to the [SDK example available in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/telerik/winforms-sdk/tree/master/Map/Custom%20Azure%20Provider), which demonstrates how to create a __custom provider__ using the __Azure Maps API__. A __valid Azure Maps subscription key__ is required to use this functionality.

The Bind Maps Rest Provider imagery service supports different types of visualization. The possible imagery sets which can be used are:

* [__Aerial with Labels__](#aerial-with-labels)
* [__Aerial without Labels__](#aerial-without-labels)
* [__AerialOnDemand__](#aerialondemand)
* [__Road__](#road)
* [__RoadOnDemand__](#roadondemand)
* [__CanvasLight__](#canvaslight)
* [__CanvasGray__](#canvasgray)
* [__CanvasDark__](#canvasdark)
 
To choose an imagery set, you can set the **ImagerySet** property of the BingRestMapProvider.
