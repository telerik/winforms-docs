# Unsupported features

The unsupported features include:

* Almost all fonts that are embedded in the PDF file should be displayed correctly. There are minimal limitations with some font formats;

* There are some limitations with CCITTFaxDecode filter;

* Lab, ICCBased color spaces;

* JPXDecode filter: This filter does not work out of the box. However, there is API allowing to plug-in custom user-defined filters. This API is described in the [Customize PDF Rendering]({%slug winforms/pdfviewer/customize-and-extensibility/customize-pdf-rendering%}) article.

* Annotations: Full support for Widget and Link annotations. All other types of annotations are supported in read-only mode.

* Structured content: There are several ways to define structured content in a PDF file. **RadPdfViewer** does not support document outline and article threads.

When a PDF file contains some of these items, it may be shown incorrectly or not shown at all.
