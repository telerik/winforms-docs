The Property Builder allows you to drag a shapes from the [RadDiagramToolbox]({%slug winforms/diagram/toolbox%}) and drop it onto the __RadDiagram__ surface. Afterwards, you can connect several shapes by using the connectors. The [RadDiagramRibbonBar]({%slug winforms/diagram/ribbonui%}) gives you a set of options to customize the diagram and save the changes as well.
