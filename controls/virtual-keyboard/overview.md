# Virtual Keyboard

Since **R1 2020** Telerik UI for WinForms suite offers a **RadVirtualKeyboard** control. It is a software component that allows the input of characters without the need for physical keys. The interaction with the virtual keyboard happens mostly via a touchscreen interface, but can also take place in a different form in virtual or augmented reality. 
On a desktop computer, a virtual keyboard might provide an alternative input mechanism for users with disabilities who cannot use a conventional keyboard, or for bi- or multi- lingual users who switch frequently between different character sets or alphabets, which may be confusing over time. Although hardware keyboards are available with dual keyboard layouts (e.g. Cyrillic/Latin letters in various national layouts), the on-screen keyboard provides a handy substitute while working at different stations or on laptops, which seldom come with dual layouts.

**RadVirtualKeyboard** will serve the need of a virtual keyboard with consistent theming for each WinForms application with Telerik UI for WinForms controls.
