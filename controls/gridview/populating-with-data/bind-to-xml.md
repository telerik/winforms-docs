# Bind to XML

Binding to XML is not directly supported but DataTables are supported and a DataSet (containing DataTables) can be created from an XML document.

This is a simple xml file used in the examples below:

````XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <people>
      <person>
        <name> John </name>
        <age> 30</age>
      </person>
      <person>
        <name> Sarah </name>
        <age> 45</age>
      </person>
      <person>
        <name> Tom</name>
        <age> 50 </age>
      </person>
    </people>
````

You have to create a DataSet instance from the XML file. For the sample XML file above, the created DataSet contains only __one__ DataTable which is set as RadGridView data source. Please refer to this [topic]({%slug winforms/gridview/hierarchical-grid/creating-hierarchy-using-an-xml-data-source%}) if you want to create hierarchy.
