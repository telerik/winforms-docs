# DateOnly / TimeOnly (.Net Only)

In .NET 6 and later, DateOnly and TimeOnly are new types introduced to work specifically with dates and times separately, without the complexity of dealing with DateTime objects when you only need one of these components. With the __Q1 2025__ official version of our controls, RadGridView control now support DateOnly / TimeOnly types in .Net applications. This integration allows developers to handle date and time only date types more efficiently, enhancing type safety and reducing potential errors.
