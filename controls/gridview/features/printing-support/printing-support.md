|[Getting Started with Printing for RadGridView](http://tv.telerik.com/watch/winforms/getting-started-with-printing-for-radgridview-)<br>This video demonstrates how to use the new Print features of RadGridView without the need to export to other formats. It also includes a tour of new end-user printing features.|![WinForms RadGridView Printing Support Tutorial](images/gridview-printing-support003.png)|

RadGridView provides printing support, which allows you to print the grid content by using [RadPrintDocument.]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/printing-support/radprintdocument%}) You are able to print:

* [ViewDefinitions]({%slug winforms/gridview/view-definitions/overview%})

* [Grouped grid]({%slug winforms/gridview/grouping/basic-grouping%})

* [Summaries]({%slug winforms/gridview/rows/summary-rows%})

* Hidden rows and Hidden columns

* Header on each page

RadGridView has two public methods available for printing - __Print()__ and  __PrintPreview()__. The first method will directly send a print job to the default printer with the settings currently saved in the [PrintStyle]({%slug winforms/gridview/printing-support/gridprintstyle%}) property. This method has one overload available which can show a system __PrintDialog__ with the available printers and their options.

{{source=..\SamplesCS\GridView\Printing support\PrintingSupport.cs region=PrintPreview}}
