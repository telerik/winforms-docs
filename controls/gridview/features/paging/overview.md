# WinForms GridView Overview

The data layer of __RadGridView__ supports pagination of data natively as of **R1 2014 (version 2014.1.226)**. You can still bind __RadGridView__ to the same [data providers]({%slug winforms/gridview/populating-with-data/bindable-types%}) as before with the addition of the paging option. There is a number of features, which will allow you to easily configure and manage the paging of the data.

To access the public API for paging you need to use the RadGridView.__MasterTemplate__ property exposing the __MasterGridViewTemplate__ object. Here are the more important properties and methods:

* __EnablePaging:__ Gets or sets a value indicating whether paging is enabled.

* __PageSize:__ Gets or sets the number of items shown per page.

* __TotalPages:__ Gets the total number of pages.

* __PageIndex:__ Gets the zero-based index of the current page.

* __CanChangePage:__ Gets a value indicating whether page change is possible.

* __IsPageChanging:__ Gets a value indicating whether a page change operation is underway.

* __MoveToFirstPage:__ Moves RadGridView to its first page.

* __MoveToPreviousPage:__ Moves RadGridView to the previous page.

* __MoveToPage(int pageIndex):__ Moves RadGridView to a specific page.

* __MoveToNextPage:__ Moves RadGridView to the next page.

* __MoveToLastPage:__ Moves RadGridView to its last page.

* __PagingBeforeGrouping:__ Gets or sets a value indicating whether paging is performed before grouping or vice versa.
