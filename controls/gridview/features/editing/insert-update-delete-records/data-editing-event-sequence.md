# Data Editing Event Sequence

## Grid editing follows a well defined sequence of events: 

* When the grid enters edit mode, the __CellBeginEdit__ event is called. The editor is loaded with the current cell value.

* On every change of the value in the editor, __ValueChanging__ event is fired just before the value is actually changed. The event can be canceled and the current edit rejected.

* If the __ValueChanging__ is not canceled the value is changed and the __ValueChanged__ event is fired.

* On closing the editor, the __Validating__ event is fired before the value can be persisted in the grid. If the __Validating__ event is canceled the value is not persisted.

* If __Validating__ is not canceled, the value is persisted and the __Validated__ event is fired.

* The __CellEndEdit__ event is called. 

* Finally the editor is closed.

Some of these events may be called multiple times. Here is a sample log of events as a string cell was put into edit mode and the string "new" was typed, then the cell was tabbed away from:

CellBeginEdit

ValueChanging
