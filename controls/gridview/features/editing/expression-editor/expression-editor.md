# Expression Editor

__RadExpressionEditor__ is a powerful editor that allows you to build complex expressions using a simple Domain Specific Language, reminiscent of formulas in many popular spreadsheet applications. It provides easy access to a set of predefined functions, operators, constants. You can also access all RadGridView fields.

Expressions consist of functions, operators, constants, and identifiers (for example, the names of fields, tables, forms, and queries). The Expression Builder enables you to easily look up and insert these components, and thereby enter expressions more quickly and accurately. Expression editor can be started from the context menu of the particular column, or it can be initialized and shown from code. RadExpressionEditor also can be used at design time.

Once shown, RadExpressionEditor automatically loads all available functions, operators and current gridâ€™s fields (columns). In addition, every entered expression is parsed and evaluated. A preview of the result is shown (for the current row of the grid) and the confirmation button is enabled only if there is a valid expression. Please note that the preview is shown only if there is at least one row at run time.
