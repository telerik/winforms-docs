# Events

The following events occur during the editing process:

__EditorRequired:__  This is the first event that fires when a cell is to become editable (edit mode). 

>note This is the right place to replace the editor with a custom one.[Here](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/controls/gridview/editors/using-custom-editors) is an example of this behavior.
>

__CellBeginEdit:__ Fires when the cell is about to enter edit mode. You can cancel edit mode at this stage byÂ  setting the __Cancel__ property to *true*.

__CellEditorInitialized:__ Fires when the editor is initialized and visible.

__CellEndEdit:__ Fires when the cell editing is finished.

__ValueChanging:__ The active editor fires this event when it is about to change its value.

__ValueChanged:__ Fires when the active editor changes its value. The data is not saved in the cell at this point.

__CellValueChanged:__ Fires when the value of a cell has been changed.

There are more events fired during this process. Please look in the [Data validation]({%slug winforms/gridview/editors/data-validation%}) section.
