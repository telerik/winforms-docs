# RadSpreadStreamProcessing Export 

The __GridViewSpreadStreamExport__ uses the [__RadSpreadStreamProcessing__](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/document-processing/libraries/radspreadstreamprocessing/overview) library which allows you to create big documents (without loading the entire document in the memory) and export them to the most common formats. 

>caption Figure 1: Exporting RadGridView.

>note The spread export functionality is located in the __TelerikExport.dll__ assembly. You need to include the following namespace in order to access the types contained in TelerikExport:
* Telerik.WinControls.Export
>

>important Since this functionality is using the __RadSpreadStreamProcessing__ library you need to reference the following assembly as well:
* Telerik.Documents.SpreadsheetStreaming

>The __TelerikExport.dll__ must be the same version as the rest of the Assemblies. `<Progress installation folder>\Bin` folder holds the assemblies targetting .NET 2.0, while the ones in `<Progress installation folder>\Bin40` are for .NET 4.0.


# Exporting

To use the spread export functionality create an instance of the __GridViewSpreadStreamExport__ object. Pass as a parameter the __RadGridView__ instance to export. Afterward, the __RunExport__ method will trigger the export process. The latter method accepts as a parameter the filename of the file to be exported and a [SpreadStreamExportRenderer]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/export-renderers/spreadstreamexportrenderer%}) instance.

Available modes are: - *ExportFirstView*: The exporter exports the first view. - *ExportCurrentlyActiveView*: The exporter exports the view that is actived in the grid. - *SelectViewToExport*: In this mode the __ChildViewExporing__ event is fired. The event allows to choose the view to export in row by row basis. - *ExportAllViews*: In this mode all child views are exported. Available in GridViewSpreadExport and GridViewPdfExport.    |

|__ExportViewDefinition__|Gets or sets a value indicating whether to export [view definition]({%slug winforms/gridview/view-definitions/overview%}) |
|__FileExportMode__ |This property determines whether the data will be exported into an existing or a new file. Available options are: __NewSheetInExistingFile__(this option will create a new sheet in an already existing file) and __CreateOrOverrideFile__ which creates new or overrides the existing file.|

>important
Each column in RadGridView has __ExcelExportType__ property which can be used for explicitly setting the data type of the cells in the exported document. In order to change the format of the exported data, you can set the __ExcelExportType__ property of the specific column to *Custom* and specify the __ExcelExportFormatString__ property with the desired format. Examples of such formats are available here: <https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Format-a-date-the-way-you-want-8e10019e-d5d8-47a1-ba95-db95123d273e?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US>

## Events

### CellFormatting

This event occurs for every cell that is being exported. It can be used for styling the cells or applying a custom format to the cells values.

#### Using the CellFormatting event

{{source=..\SamplesVB\GridView\ExportingData\SpreadStreamExportCode.vb region=CellFormatting}}
````C#
private void SpreadStreamExport_CellFormatting(object sender, SpreadStreamCellFormattingEventArgs e)
{
    e.CellStyleInfo.BackColor = Color.Green;
    e.CellStyleInfo.ForeColor = Color.Red;
    e.CellStyleInfo.BottomBorder = new SpreadBorder(SpreadBorderStyle.Double, SpreadThemableColor.FromRgb(100, 100, 100));
    e.CellStyleInfo.TopBorder = Color.Black;
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub SpreadStreamExport_CellFormatting(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SpreadStreamCellFormattingEventArgs)
    e.CellStyleInfo.BackColor = Color.Green
    e.CellStyleInfo.ForeColor = Color.Red
    e.CellStyleInfo.BottomBorder = New SpreadBorder(SpreadBorderStyle.Double, SpreadThemableColor.FromRgb(100, 100, 100))
    e.CellStyleInfo.TopBorder = Color.Black
End Sub

### RowCreated

Occurs when a new row is created in current worksheet. This is suitable place to set any row properties (like height) and/or add indent cells.

#### Using RowCreated to set the rows height.

{{source=..\SamplesCS\GridView\ExportingData\SpreadStreamExportCode.cs region=RowCreated}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\GridView\ExportingData\SpreadStreamExportCode.vb region=RowCreated}}
````C#

{
    if (e.GridRowInfoType == typeof(GridViewTableHeaderRowInfo))
    {
        var row = e.Row as Telerik.Documents.SpreadsheetStreaming.IRowExporter;
        row.SetHeightInPixels(50);
    }
}

````
````VB.NET
Private Sub SpreadStreamExport_RowCreated(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As SpreadStreamRowEventArgs)
    If e.GridRowInfoType Is GetType(GridViewTableHeaderRowInfo) Then
        Dim row = TryCast(e.Row, Telerik.Documents.SpreadsheetStreaming.IRowExporter)
        row.SetHeightInPixels(50)
    End If
End Sub

````

### RowExporting 

Occurs before every spread row is exported. This is suitable place to add any additional cells at the end of the row.

{{source=..\SamplesVB\GridView\ExportingData\SpreadStreamExportCode.vb region=RowExporting}}

            cell.SetFormat(format);
        }
    }

    End If
End Sub

### ExportCompleted

Occurs when the export process completes. This event is suitable for notifying the user that the exported operation is now completed.

### ChildViewExporting

Occurs when a child view will be exported. This event is suitable for checking whether a child view will be exported or not.

# Asynchronous Export

This feature can be utilized by calling the __RunExportAsync__ method on the __GridViewSpreadStreamExport__ object. In addition there are two events that fire when this export method is used:
* __AsyncExportCompleted:__ Fires when the export operation is completed.
* __AsyncExportProgressChanged:__ Fires repeatedly and passes the current export progress.

>note When you are exporting with visual settings the UI would be friezed for some time. This is necessary because the exporter need to retrieve all grid styles and this operation is executed on the UI thread. 
>
