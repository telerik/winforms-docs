# Cross Reference

Cross-References represent fields that refer to a part of the document. When that part changes, these fields can be updated to reflect the change. You can have a Cross-Reference to a Caption, Heading or Bookmark. 

You can insert a Cross-Reference from here:

This article covers:

* [Insert Cross-Reference](#insert-cross-reference)

* [Type of Cross-References](#types-of-cross-references)

* [Inserting a Cross-Reference using RadRichTextEditor’s API](#inserting-a-cross-reference-using-radrichtexteditors-api)

## Insert Cross-Reference

The dialog looks like this:

![WinForms RadRichTextEditor Insert Cross-Reference](images/richtexteditor-features-references-cross-reference002.png)

You can choose between 4 Reference types: __Figure__, __Table__, __Bookmark__ and  __Heading__.

![WinForms RadRichTextEditor Reference Types](images/richtexteditor-features-references-cross-reference003.png)

When you have chosen the [type of the reference](#types-of-cross-references), you should choose one of the items in the "*Insert reference to:*" combo box. The items depend on the selected item in the "Reference type" combo box.
        
The __Insert as hyperlink__ check box, if checked, will create the field as a hyperlink to the appropriate part of the document. You can click on it while pressing `Ctrl`. This will force the cursor to move to the start of the part being referenced.
        
The __For which element__ list box shows all the items of the appropriate type that can be chosen.        

Clicking on the __Insert__ button inserts the __Cross-Reference__ to the document.
        
## Types of Cross-References

### Figure

These are the options you have when you select the __Figure__ reference type:

![WinForms RadRichTextEditor Types of Cross-References](images/richtexteditor-features-references-cross-reference003.png)

* __Entire Caption__ – inserts a field with text equal to the entire caption. In this case the text would be "Figure 1 CaptionText".
                
* __Only label and number__ - inserts only the label and the number after it. In this case: "Figure 1".
                
* __Only caption text__ - – inserts the caption text only: "CaptionText" (the text after the label and the number).
                
* __Page number__ - inserts the number of the page on which the field is located. For example, if the field is on the third page, the text would be "3".
                
* __Above/Below__ – inserts the position of the field relative to the part being referenced. For example, if we have a __Caption__ on the first line of the page and we decide to insert a __Cross-Reference__ in the middle  of the same page to that __Caption__. We will get the following text – "Above".
                
### Table

__Table__ and __Figure__ are both __Captions__ so they have the same options.

### Heading

These are the options when __Heading__ is selected:

![WinForms RadRichTextEditor Heading](images/richtexteditor-features-references-cross-reference005.png)

* __Heading text__ - inserts a field with text equal to the one in the heading chosen. For example, here we have a paragraph with text “Heading1” (and style *Heading1*). The text inserted by the field would be "Heading1".
                
* __Page Number__ - inserts the number of the page on which the field is located. For example, if the field is on the fifth page, the text would be “5”.                

* __Above/Below__ - inserts the position of the field relative to the part being referenced. For example, if we have a __Caption__ in the middle of the page and we decide to insert a Cross-Reference on the first line of the same page to that Caption. We will get the following text – "Below".

### Bookmark

When __Bookmark__ item is selected in the list with all available bookmarks you see only the names (not the text as with captions  and headings)

 ![WinForms RadRichTextEditor Bookmark](images/richtexteditor-features-references-cross-reference006.png)

* __Bookmark text__ - inserts the text in the bookmark. Here the name is shown, not the text. So the field would look something like "*Bookmark Text Here*", given that this is the text of the bookmark with name "Bookmark".
                
* __Page number__ – inserts the number of the page on which the field is located. For example, if the field is on the seventh page, the text would be "7".
               
* __Above/Below__ – inserts the position of the field relative to the part being referenced. For example, if we have a  __Caption__ on the first line of the page and we decide to insert a Cross-Reference in the middle of the page to that   __Caption__ we will get the text "Above".                

## Inserting a Cross-Reference using RadRichTextEditor’s API

All types of __Cross-References__ can be inserted using methods of __RadRichTextEditor__.
       
### Inserting Cross-Reference to a Bookmark

Every bookmark has a unique name. So in order to insert a reference to a bookmark, you need its name. __RadRichTextEditor__ has the following method:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\CrossReference.cs region=bookmark}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\CrossReference.vb region=bookmark}} 

````C#
radRichTextEditor1.InsertCrossReferenceToBookmark("Bookmark Name", ReferenceContentType.EntireContent, false);

````
````VB.NET
radRichTextEditor1.InsertCrossReferenceToBookmark("Bookmark Name", ReferenceContentType.EntireContent, False)

````

{{endregion}} 

__ReferenceContentType__ is an enumeration that has five values – __EntireContent__, __OnlyLabelAndNumber__, __OnlyCaption__, __PageNumber__ and __RelativePosition__. As you can see, those values are the same as in the "Insert reference to:" combo box. The parameter "InsertAsHyperlink" is pretty self-explanatory and also can be read about [in this section](#insert-cross-reference).

### Inserting Cross-Reference to a Heading

You have to pass the paragraph (with heading style applied, of course) that you want to create a Reference to. The method signature is as follows:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\CrossReference.cs region=heading}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\CrossReference.vb region=heading}}

````C#
radRichTextEditor1.InsertCrossReferenceToHeading(headingParagraph, ReferenceContentType.OnlyCaption, true);

````
````VB.NET
radRichTextEditor1.InsertCrossReferenceToHeading(headingParagraph, ReferenceContentType.OnlyCaption, True)

```` 

{{endregion}}

The parameters are almost the same, except the first one. It represents the paragraph you want to reference. The other two have the same purpose.

### Inserting Cross-Reference to a Caption

The method signature is:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RichTextEditor\Features\CrossReference.cs region=caption}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RichTextEditor\Features\CrossReference.vb region=caption}} 

````C#
radRichTextEditor1.InsertCrossReferenceToCaption(captionParagraph, ReferenceContentType.OnlyLabelAndNumber,false);

````
````VB.NET
radRichTextEditor1.InsertCrossReferenceToCaption(captionParagraph, ReferenceContentType.OnlyLabelAndNumber, False)

````

{{endregion}}

The first parameter represents the paragraph (__Caption__) you want to refer.
