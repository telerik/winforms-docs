## Adding Tiles

In order to add or remove tiles either click on the “*Edit items*” link in the **Smart Tag** or edit the __Items__ collection in the Properties window in Visual Studio. This will open the *RadItem Collection Editor*. You can add two types of elements to the __Items__ collection: __RadTileElement__ and __RadLiveTileElement__.

## Adding Groups

To add or remove groups click on the “*Edit Groups*” link in the **Smart Tag** or edit the __Groups__ collection in the Properties window in Visual Studio. To add tiles to a group, edit the __Items__ collection of the group itself. Switching between grouped or ungrouped view, is achieved by checking or unchecking the **ShowGroups** check box in the **Smart Tag** or setting the __ShowGroups__ property in the Properties window in Visual Studio.
