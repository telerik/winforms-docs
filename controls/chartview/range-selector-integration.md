# Range Selector Integration

__RadChartView__ can be associated with a __RadRangeSelector__ control. This integration is extremely useful in scenarios requiring the end-users to deal with large data sets in __RadChartView__. __RadRangeSelector__ creates a mini-map of the chart data allowing quick scrolling and navigation along the view port of the chart. This way a particular portion of the data can be instantly displayed in a user-friendly manner.
