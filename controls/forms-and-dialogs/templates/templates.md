# Templates

The Visual Studio templates that install with Telerik UI for WinForms let you add [RadForm]({%slug winforms/forms-and-dialogs/form%}) and [ShapedForm]({%slug winforms/forms-and-dialogs/shapedform%}) to your application without any coding steps. There are also two other specialized forms, __RadRibbonForm__ that contains a built-in __RadRibbonBar__ and __RadAboutBox__ that is an enhanced, themeable version of the regular AboutBox.
