# Preview Release

The Preview is a minor release of the **Telerik UI for WinForms** assemblies, that is uploaded between the major releases. The major releases are Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. Unlike the scheduled major releases, the Preview versions are released on demand which means their frequency can vary from none to several versions between two major releases. This approach allows more flexibility as the users can test the latest bug fixes and provide feedback before the major release is launched.

## Downloading the Preview Release

The Preview is __available as a NuGet__ package. Alternatively, you can __download the Preview assemblies__ from [your telerik.com account](https://www.telerik.com/account/).

1. Go to the Telerik UI for WinForms product [download page](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads/product-download?product=RCWF).

2. Click on the __Latest Internal Build__ button. This will download an archive with the Telerik UI for WinForms assemblies.
