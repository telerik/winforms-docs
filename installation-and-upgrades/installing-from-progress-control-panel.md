## Download and Log-in

To start, download the Progress Control Panel from the following [page](https://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file/v2/control-panel) and run the downloaded .exe file. You will soon be presented with the login screen where you need to provide your Telerik account credentials to sign in.

## Select Products to Install

Afterwards, you will be presented with a screen containing sections for All products, Purchased products, Trial products, and Free products. These sections each have a split screen view - the left contains installed products that can be updated and the right contains products that can be installed.

You can continue by selecting the Telerik UI for WinForms suite. Once you click the check box, the option to proceed or cancel will be displayed.
