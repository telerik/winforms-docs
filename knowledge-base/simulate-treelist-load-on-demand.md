## Description

This tutorial demonstrates how to simulate a TreeList control with load on demand hierarchy: 

![simulate-treelist-load-on-demand](images/simulate-treelist-load-on-demand.png)

 
## Solution 

The illustrated result is achieved with a RadTreeView by two main steps:

1. Create a [custom node element]({%slug winforms/treeview/working-with-nodes/custom-nodes%}) that contains a header container with the header cells and a data container with the data cells.
2. Build a [custom editor]({%slug winforms/treeview/working-with-nodes/custom-nodes%}) which allows editing the Title, Date, DeliveryType fields.

>note A complete C# and VB project is available [here](https://github.com/telerik/winforms-sdk/tree/master/TreeView/SelfRefLoadOnDemandGrid)
