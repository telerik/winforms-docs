## Problem

Opening a RadForm's designer with Telerik controls in a project that targets .NET Core will bring errors and the designer won't be loaded.

>important Resolved with releasing the [NET Core Design Time]({%slug core-design-time%}).

## Solution

The WinForms designer in .NET Core is still in its preview and currently it misses key features like support for libraries of third-party vendors. We are closely working with Microsoft to determine the best possible implementation approach. At the moment, we cannot provide you with a time estimate for a possible release or preview of the feature. I would recommend you to have a look at the following blog post that Microsoft released on this topic: [Windows Forms Designer for .NET Core Released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/windows-forms-designer-for-net-core-released/?fbclid=IwAR2q7fHPZ4RgS8bZwQSnTPjWqpKPOpxzc3j5PmPA-U4qbpF9xk0Iet4h_NE). 

I can suggest referring the official Microsoft documentation for details on porting a project built on the full .NET framework to .NET Core: [Overview of porting from .NET Framework to .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/). Please bear in mind that the project file format in .NET Core is different so it will be necessary to update the old .csproj files. Microsoft have developed a tool to automate this process: [Try-Convert](https://github.com/dotnet/try-convert).

  
As for the designer, please note that even the Microsoft implementation is still limited and only available as a preview in Visual Studio. If you need to target .NET Core and have complex designers you may consider trying the workaround as explained here: [Windows Forms .NET Core Designer](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/docs/winforms-designer.md). With this approach you can still target .NET Core and at the same time achieve the design-time experience you are already used to.
