## Problem

You like the new __Crystal__ and __CrystalDark__ themes but you do not want the title bar buttons to be on the left. 

## Solution

Edit the theme and change a single property which will affect all forms. Here are the detailed steps:

1\. Extract the predefined themes, which will allow you to edit the crystal theme: [Loading Predefined Themes]({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder/working-with-visual-style-builder/loading-predefined-themes%})

2\.	Change the RightToLeft property in the theme.

3\.	Save and use the new theme in your application: [Using custom themes]({%slug winforms/themes/using-custom-themes%})

That is all that needs to be done and you can use the same approach for both Crystal and CrystalDark themes.
