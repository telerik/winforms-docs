## Description


Let's start with having a trial version installed on your machine and a project that uses the trial version:

If you expand the **References** in the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio, you will see the trial assemblies are added to the project:

## Solution

Once you purchase a Telerik license, you will have access to the *Purchase* **License Type** in your [Telerik account]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/download-product-files%}):

3\. **Install** the downloaded .msi file in step 1.

4\. [Update the references]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/updating-assemblies-in-a-project%}) in your project with the assemblies from the latest installation.

5\. **Delete** the license.licx file. 

6\. **Rebuild** your project, close Visual Studio and open it again to make sure that no references are kept in the memory by Visual Studio. 

7\. **Ensure** that [no old versions are available in GAC]({%slug radcontrols-examine-the-gac%}):
