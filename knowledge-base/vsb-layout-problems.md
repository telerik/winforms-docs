There are cases in which [Visual Style Builder]({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder%}) may not open properly indicating any XML errors. In other cases, the VSB tool may open successfully but its layout is totally messed up.

## Solution

Since **R2 2018 SP1** [Visual Style Builder]({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder%}) is DPI-aware. Usually, the layout file of Visual Style Builder may store some old settings which leads to the undesired result illustrated above. 

A common solution to this behavior is to close Visual Style Builder. Please navigate to the **C:\Users\'your user name'\AppData\Roaming\Telerik\WinForms\VSB** folder and delete the **VsbLayout.xml**. Restart Visual Style Builder and now it should be loaded as expected.
