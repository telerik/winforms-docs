## Description

By design, **RadTreeView** allows customizing the visual node elements. The [Custom Nodes]({%slug winforms/treeview/working-with-nodes/custom-nodes%}) help article demonstrates a step-by-step tutorial how to use a custom **TreeNodeElement** for all nodes in the tree view. However, a common scenario is to use different custom node elements for the different levels in the tree view.

## Solution

The aforementioned help article explains detailed steps how to create a custom node element. If you wish to have different custom node elements for the first and second levels in the tree view, you just need to implement two different custom **TreeNodeElement** derivatives with the relevant custom **TreeNodeContentElement** classes. 

Thanks to the UI virtualization mechanism only the currently visible node elements are created and they are further reused when needed. A node element is reused in other nodes if they are compatible with them. The important part here is to override the **IsCompatible** method of the **TreeNodeElement**. This method expects a Boolean result indicating whether the visual node element is applicable to the passed **RadTreeNode**. Thus, you can check the RadTreeNode.**Level** property indicating the hierarchical level of the node and determine which visual node element to use.
