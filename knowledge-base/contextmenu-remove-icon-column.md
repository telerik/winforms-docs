## Description

In some scenarios, RadContextMenu items in WinForms applications do not have icons. The default layout includes a column for icons, which may be unnecessary and consume space. This article demonstrates how to reduce or hide the icon column in RadContextMenu for a cleaner user interface.

## Solution

To remove or hide the icon column in the RadContextMenu, modify the `LeftColumnMinWidth` property of the `RadDropDownMenuLayout`. Setting this property to `0` effectively hides the space reserved for icons. 

Here is a code snippet demonstrating these steps:

````C#

RadDropDownMenuElement element = this.radContextMenu1.DropDown.PopupElement as RadDropDownMenuElement;
RadDropDownMenuLayout layout = element.LayoutPanel as RadDropDownMenuLayout;
layout.LeftColumnMinWidth = 0;

````

This code removes the space on the left side of the drop-down menu that is typically reserved for icons, providing a cleaner look when your menu items do not require icons.
