## Description

Product Alert – May 2024 - CVE-2024-3892

- Telerik UI for WinForms v2021.1.122 to v2024.1.312

### Issue

CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')

In Telerik UI for WinForms versions v2021.1.122 to v2024.1.312, it is possible to manipulate the application configuration to register a specially crafted external assembly as a theme.

### What are the Impacts

This can allow a preexisting local threat actor to execute local code at the same permission level as the application the next time the application is launched. 

## Solution

We have addressed the vulnerability and the Progress Telerik team strongly recommends performing an upgrade to the latest version listed in the table below.

| Version | Guidance |
|-----------|--------------|
| Earlier than 2021.1.122   | Not Affected |
| 2021.1.122 to 2024.1.312 | Update to v2024.2.514 [Update Instructions](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/knowledge-base/how-to-upgrade-a-project) |
| 2024.2.514 or later | Not Affected |

To confirm your current version of UI for WinForms, check the version of Telerik.WinControls.dll the project is referencing. All customers who have a UI for WinForms license can access the downloads here [Product Download | Your Account](https://www.telerik.com/account/downloads/product-download?product=RCWF).

## Notes

- The threat actor must already have access to the local system, this is not a remote code execution vulnerability.
- The arbitrary code in the custom precompiled assembly can only be executed at the same privilege as the application.
- Modification of a running application’s configuration is not successful; this attack must be implemented pre-launch.

If you have any questions or concerns related to this issue, open a new Technical Support case in [Your Account | Support Center](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-center). Technical Support is available to Telerik customers with an active support plan.
