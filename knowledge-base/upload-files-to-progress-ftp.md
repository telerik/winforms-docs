## Description

When a client needs to provide a file that exceeds the limit in the support-ticketing system, the files exchange is performed by using the Progress SFTP. The agent handling the ticket, should create an account for the customer and provide *Username*, *Password*, *Server Name* and *Server Port* to the client to access the created account and upload the files.

>caution Keep in mind that all created accounts and all uploaded data is deleted from the server after 30 days to provide enough space for all following uploads. Make sure to upload/download all needed information in time as there will be no backups configured on the server.

## Solution

All details needed by the customer to establish a SFTP connection to the server are *Username*, *Password*, *Server Name* and *Server Port*:
