## Solution 

As of R2 2018 Telerik UI for WinForms suite offers an [Image Editor]({%slug radimageeditor-overview%}) which allows you not only to pan and zoom images, but also to manipulate them. For all previous versions, feel free to use the custom pan and zoom image control which full implementation is available for download [here](https://github.com/telerik/winforms-sdk/tree/master/Genral_All_Controls/PanAndZoomExample).
