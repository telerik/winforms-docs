## Description

A common case is to observe the Telerik controls displayed twice in the Visual Studio Toolbox:

## Solution

The first thing to try is to **reset** the Visual Studio **Toolbox** by right-clicking on it and selecting *Reset Toolbox* option. Alternatively, you can uninstall the Telerik UI for WinForms suite and [install]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/installing-on-your-computer%}) it again.

Another approach is to:

1. Close all Visual Studio instances.
2. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to **%localappdata%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\15.0_<instanceID>** (e.g. VS 2017). Note that you might have several such folders according to the Visual Studio versions that are installed.
3. Make sure that the option '*Show hidden files, folders, and drives*' is selected in the Windows Explorer options.
4. Delete all *.tbd files.
5. Start Visual Studio 2017 and check if the issue still persists.

If there is no Telerik controls in the toolbox please use [Toolbox Configuration Wizard]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/visual-studio-extensions/toolbox-configurator%}) to set them.
