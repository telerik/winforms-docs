## Description

The following licensing warnings occur when building a .NET Framework project using Visual Studio 2019, when a license key is installed.

* `No Telerik or Kendo UI product references detected in project. Consult the product documentation or contanct support at progress.com`

* `No license key found`

## Solution

The error manifests because of a limitation in the licensing implementation when loaded in the specific setup. You can safely ignore it. Alternatively, use Visual Studio 2022.
