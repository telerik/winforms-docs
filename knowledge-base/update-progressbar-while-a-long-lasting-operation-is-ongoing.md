## Description

Many users face a similar issue: once a time-consuming operation is started, **RadProgressBar** does not update immediately and literally freezes. Such cases occur when the long-running operation is executed on the same thread as the **RadProgressBar** update process: the primary UI Thread. The operation does not allow the form to update its UI and as a result the control does not perform any visual updates.

## Solution 

One obvious solution is to start the time-consuming operation in a new thread. A sample approach to achieve this is by using a [BackgroundWorker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/winforms/controls/how-to-run-an-operation-in-the-background).  

The BackgroundWorker.[ProgressChanged](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.backgroundworker.reportprogress?view=netframework-4.8) event is used to update the value of **RadProgressBar**:
