**HOW-TO**  

Iterate through RadGridView Rows.  
   
**SOLUTION**

When you want to iterate through the rows of your RadGridView, you should use either **RadGridView.Rows** or **RadGridView.MasterTemplate.Rows** collection. Both are references to the actual rows collection, bound to the underlying data, and processed by grid's automatic filtering, grouping, and sorting features.  
   
Iterating through theÂ **RadGridView.MasterView.Rows** is a bit slower performance-wise, but this collection is more useful when working in hierarchy mode. It is slower, because the **GridViewInfo.Rows** property is calculated on each request, based on the UI state of the current **GridViewInfo**. For example these are the rows in one sub-detail view in the hierarchy.
