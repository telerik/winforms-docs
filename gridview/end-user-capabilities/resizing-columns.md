# Resizing Columns

The columns inside the RadGridView are resizable by default. You can easily change the column width by positioning the mouse over the columns vertical grid line and dragging it until the desired size is achieved. The width of columns can be set individually, per column. Note that the visible width will always include some amount of data even when set to very small amounts.
