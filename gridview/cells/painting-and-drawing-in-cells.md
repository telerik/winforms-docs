Painting and drawing in Cells

## 

There are cases when you need to manually draw in a cell in order to extend the cell appearance and/or provide additional information to the user about the cell data. RadGridView supports this case via the CellPaint event. To enable the event firing just set the __EnableCustomDrawing__ to *true* of the RadGridView control. 

>note When handling this event, you should access the cell through the parameters of the event handler, rather than access the cell directly.
>


The following example demonstrates how to use the __CellPaint__ event to change the appearance of the cells in a "UnitPrice" column. We would like to add a custom drawn red asterisk to values less than 20, a green asterisk to values higher than 20, and no asterisk when the cell's value is zero:

void radGridView1_CellPaint(object sender, Telerik.WinControls.UI.GridViewCellPaintEventArgs e)

    GridDataCellElement dataCell = e.Cell as GridDataCellElement;
    if (dataCell != null && dataCell.ColumnInfo.Name == "UnitPrice" && !(dataCell.RowElement is GridFilterRowElement))
    {
        double value = Convert.ToDouble(dataCell.Value);
        if (value == 0)
        {
            return;
        }
        Brush brush = value < 20 ? Brushes.Red : Brushes.Green;
        Size cellSize = e.Cell.Size;
        using (Font font = new Font("Segoe UI", 17))
        {
            e.Graphics.DrawString("*", font, brush, Point.Empty);
