# License Activation Errors and Warnings

Starting with the __2025 Q1 release__, using Telerik UI for .NET WinForms without a license or with an invalid license causes specific license warnings and errors. This article defines what an invalid license is, explains what is causing it, and describes the related license warnings and errors.

## Invalid License

An invalid license can be caused by any of the following:

- Using an expired subscription licenseâ€”subscription licenses expire at the end of the subscription term.
- Using a perpetual license for product versions released outside the validity period of your license.
- Using an expired trial license.
- A missing license for Telerik UI for .NET WinForms.
- Not installing a license key in your application.
- Not updating the license key after renewing your Telerik UI for .NET WinForms license.

## License Warnings and Errors

When using Telerik UI for .NET WinForms in a project with an expired or missing license, the `Telerik.Licensing` build task will indicate the following errors:

| Error or Condition                              | Solution                                                                                      |
