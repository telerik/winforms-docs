# Views



RadListView supports three __ViewTypes__ – *ListView*, *IconsView* and *DetailsView*. Those are the basic views that every Windows user is familiar with since Windows Explorer offers them all. With RadListView you can extend the view types functionality and customize its appearance in order to fit your needs.
     

## ListView

The __ListView__ view has much the same look as RadListControl. It uses the engine of RadListView and takes benefits like checkboxes, editors and images from it. The __ListView__ view consists of vertically stacked list items:

## IconsView

The __IconView__ displays the list items in icons, a manner that you surely are familiar with from the Windows Explorer. Its __Orientation__ property determines how the icons will be displayed:

## DetailView

The __DetailView__ provides a grid-like interface for displaying items with more than one data fields. Interesting features in this view are the options to resize columns (__AllowColumnResize__), to reorder columns  (__AllowColumnReorder__), set the columns sizes and to determine which columns will be visible and which aren’t.
