# Shape Editor User Interface

The __Custom Shape Editor__ consists of a grid area where the shape is drawn, a Property Pane for fine  tuning exact coordinates and other properties, and a tool bar below the grid area. The toolbar area has several tools "Snap to..." tools that make it easier to get the points in the shape to conform to features in the shape such as the grid, other points and lines.  The Zoom tool lets you type in a size percentage or select from the list. The Grid Size tool lets you control the level of granularity for the grid that overlays the shape in the editor. The last set of tools on the bottom right of the toolbar automatically size the shape or the bounds of editing area.
