# Adding RadThemeManager to a Form

__RadThemeManager__ is an non-visual component that manages the connection between themes (stored in XML files) and Telerik UI for WinForms controls on your form. To apply a theme to a control, the form containing the control must also contain a __RadThemeManager__.

There are two ways to add a __RadThemeManager__ to your form:

* From the toolbox.

* From the __Smart Tag__ menu of any Telerik RadControl.

## Adding a Theme Manager from the Toolbox

From the __Telerik UI for WinForms__ tab of the toolbox, drag a __RadThemeManager__ component and drop it anywhere on your form. This action will create a __RadThemeManager__ control in the form component tray area.

## Adding a Theme Manager from the Smart Tag Menu

Select any RadControl on your form. Open the __Smart Tag__ menu, and then click __New Theme Manager__.
