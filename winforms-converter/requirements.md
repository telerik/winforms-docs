# Requirements

The following article lists what is required in order to be able to use the controls converter.

* __Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3__

* __.NET 4.7.1__ - You can download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56115).

* Solution that contains project with default .NET controls.

>important The WinForms converter crashes when converting a project with Visual Studio 2017 18.7 or newer. This is caused because in the latest version of Visual Studio a type used in the converter was moved.
