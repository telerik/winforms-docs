# WinForms Converter

This tool allows you to convert the standard .NET Windows Forms controls for all projects in a particular solution to their equivalent in Telerik UI for WinForms. It aims to speed up the conversion process and save time when such projects are modernized. The tool is built on top of the Roselyn compiler platform. Here are the main capabilities:

* __Large number of supported controls__ - complete list of the converted controls is available here: [Supported Controls]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/visual-studio-extensions/supported-controls%}) You can chose which controls to convert as well.

* __Real-Time differences__ - after the project is converted you can view the differences in Visual Studio.

* __Auto BackUp Support__ - by default the tool creates a project backup. You can find it in the project folder.  

* __Conversion Log__ - Conversion log is created when the process is completed. It contains a complete list of all converted files.   

* __Convert to a specific version__ - you can choose to which version of __Telerik UI for WinForms__ you want to convert. 

* Visual Basic and C# projects are supported.
